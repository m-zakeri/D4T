<h2>Apache Ant API has not been generated</h2>

<p>If you see this page online at <a target="_top"
href="https://ant.apache.org/">ant.apache.org</a>, it is not a bug, but on purpose.  We do not
provide an online version of the API docs, they are included with all our distributions.</p>

<p>Ant's manual and API documentation is part of
the <a href="https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi" target="_top">binary</a> distributions or
available as a separate <a href="https://ant.apache.org/manualdownload.cgi"
target="_top">archive</a>.</p>
