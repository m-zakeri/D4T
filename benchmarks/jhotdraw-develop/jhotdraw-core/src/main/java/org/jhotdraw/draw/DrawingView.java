/**
 * A <em>drawing view</em> paints a {@link Drawing} on a {@code JComponent}.
 * <p>
 * A drawing view can hold only one drawing at a time, but a drawing can be in
 * multiple drawing views at the same time.
 * <p>
 * {@code DrawingView} can paint the drawing with a scale factor. It supports
 * conversion between view coordinates and drawing coordinates.
 * <p>
 * {@code DrawingView} maintains a selection of the {@link Figure}s contained in
 * the drawing. When a figure is selected, the drawing view request {@link Handle}s
 * from the figure and draws them on top of the drawing.
 * <p>
 * To support editing, a drawing view needs to be added to a {@link DrawingEditor}.
 * The current {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.tool.Tool} of the drawing editor
 * receives mouse and key events from all drawing views of the drawing editor.
 * When added to an editor, the drawing view paints the current {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.tool.Tool} on
 * top of the drawing. The selected figures and handles can be the targets of
 * the current tool of the drawing editor.
 * <p>
 * Editing operations can be constrained, for example by a grid. The constraints
 * are defined by a {@link Constrainer} object. Handles and tools should take
 * the constrainer of the drawing view into account when editing a figure.
 * <p>
 * The painting process of {@code DrawingView} view involves the following steps:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Paint the background of the drawing view.</li>
 * <li>Invoke {@link Drawing#drawCanvas}.</li>
 * <li>Invoke {@link Constrainer#draw} if a constrainer is set.</li>
 * <li>Invoke {@link Drawing#draw}.</li>
 * <li>Invoke {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.handle.Handle#draw} on the handles
 * of selected figures.</li>
 * <li>Invoke {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.tool.Tool#draw} if the drawing view
 * is the active view of the {@code DrawingEditor}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <hr>
 * <b>Design Patterns</b>
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Framework</em><br>
 * The following interfaces define the contracts of a framework for structured
 * drawing editors:<br>
 * Contract: {@link Drawing}, {@link Figure}, {@link DrawingView},
 * {@link DrawingEditor}, {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.handle.Handle} and
 * {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.tool.Tool}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Chain of responsibility</em><br>
 * Mouse and keyboard events of the user occur on the drawing view, and are
 * preprocessed by the {@code DragTracker} of a {@code SelectionTool}. In
 * turn {@code org.jhotdraw.draw.selectiontool.DragTracker} invokes "track" methods on a {@code Handle} which in
 * turn changes an aspect of a figure.<br>
 * Client: {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.tool.SelectionTool};
 * Handler: {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.tool.DragTracker},
 * {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.handle.Handle}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Mediator</em><br>
 * {@code DrawingEditor} acts as a mediator for coordinating drawing tools
 * and drawing views:<br>
 * Mediator: {@link DrawingEditor};
 * Colleagues: {@link DrawingView}, {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.tool.Tool}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Model-View-Controller</em><br>
 * The following classes implement together the Model-View-Controller design
 * pattern:<br>
 * Model: {@link Drawing}; View: {@link DrawingView}; Controller:
 * {@link DrawingEditor}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Observer</em><br>
 * Selection changes of {@code DrawingView} are observed by user interface
 * components which act on selected figures.<br>
 * Subject: {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.DrawingView};
 * Observer: {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.event.FigureSelectionListener};
 * Event: {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.event.FigureSelectionEvent}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Observer</em><br>
 * State changes of figures can be observed by other objects. Specifically
 * {@code CompositeFigure} observes area invalidations and remove requests
 * of its child figures. {@code DrawingView} also observes area invalidations
 * of its drawing object.
 * Subject: {@link Figure}; Observer:
 * {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.event.FigureListener};
 * Event: {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.event.FigureEvent};
 * Concrete Observer: {@link CompositeFigure}, {@link DrawingView}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Observer</em><br>
 * State changes of handles can be observed by other objects. Specifically
 * {@code DrawingView} observes area invalidations and remove requests of
 * handles.<br>
 * Subject: {@link Handle};
 * Observer: {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.event.HandleListener};
 * Event: {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.event.HandleEvent};
 * Concrete Observer: {@link DrawingView}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Strategy</em><br>
 * Editing can be constrained by a constrainer which is associated to a
 * drawing view.<br>
 * Context: {@link DrawingView}; Strategy: {@link Constrainer}.
