 * <em>Prototype</em><br>
 * The image tool creates new figures by cloning a prototype figure object.
 * That's the reason why {@code Figure} extends the {@code Cloneable} interface.

 * Prototype: {@link ImageHolderFigure};
 * Client: {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.tool.ImageTool}.

 * <p>
 * <em>Prototype</em><br>
 * The image input format creates new image holder figures by cloning a prototype figure
 * object and assigning an image to it, which was read from data input.
 * That's the reason why {@code Figure} extends the {@code Cloneable} interface.
