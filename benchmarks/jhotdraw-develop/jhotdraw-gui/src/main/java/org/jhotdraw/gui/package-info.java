 * <b>Features</b>
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Activity monitoring</em><br>
 * Background activities can be monitored using the {@link org.jhotdraw.gui.ActivityModel} class.
 * A activity model can have an owner. This allows to associate activities to
 * different views of an application.
 * All current activity models can be viewed in the {@link org.jhotdraw.gui.JActivityWindow}.
 * A {@code JActivityIndicator} can be used to indicate that one or more
 * activity is active. {@code JActivityIndicator} can either indicate all
 * running activities, or only those belonging to a specific owner.
 * </p>
