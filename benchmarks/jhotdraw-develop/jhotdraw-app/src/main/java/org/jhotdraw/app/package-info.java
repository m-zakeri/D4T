/**
 * Defines a framework for document oriented applications and provides default
 * implementations.
 * <p>
 * Supports single document interface (SDI), multiple document interface (MDI),
 * the Mac OS X application document interface (OSX), and applets.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Key interfaces in this framework: {@link org.jhotdraw.app.Application},
 * {@link org.jhotdraw.app.ApplicationModel}, {@link org.jhotdraw.app.View}.
 * </p>
 * <hr>
 * <b>Features</b>
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Launch application</em><br>
 * Reads command line parameters, creates initial windows and menu bars and
 * then opens the first view(s).<br>
 * For this feature, you are supposed to implement your own {@code Main} class,
 * which creates an {@code Application} of the desired type, creates and configures
 * an {@code ApplicationModel}, sets the class name of the desired {@code View}s
 * on the {@code ApplicationModel} and then invokes the {@code Application.launch(args)}
 * method. See the class comments of {@link org.jhotdraw.app.Application} for example code.<br>
 * The core behavior of this feature is implemented in {@link org.jhotdraw.app.Application#launch}.<br>
 * Data is supplied by your {@code Main} class.<br>
 * This feature triggers the following features: <em>Open last URI on launch</em>,
 * <em>Open URIs from command line on launch</em>.<br>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Open last URI on launch</em><br>
 * When the application is started, the last opened URI is opened in a view.<br>
 * The core behavior of this feature is implemented in {@link org.jhotdraw.app.Application#launch}.<br>
 * This feature is enabled if {@link org.jhotdraw.app.ApplicationModel#isOpenLastURIOnLaunch()} returns true.<br>
 * The last opened URI is retrieved from {@link org.jhotdraw.app.Application#getRecentURIs()}.<br>
 * The last opened URI's are supplied by actions that open files.
 * Known data suppliers are org.jhotdraw.app.action.file.OpenFileAction,
 * {@link org.jhotdraw.app.action.app.OpenApplicationFileAction},
 * {@link org.jhotdraw.app.action.file.SaveFileAction},
 * {@link org.jhotdraw.app.action.file.LoadFileAction}.<br>
 * The data suppliers use method {@link org.jhotdraw.app.Application#addRecentURI}.<br>
 * This feature triggers the following feature: <em>Open URIs on launch</em>.<br>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Open URIs from command line on launch</em><br>
 * When the application is started, each URI given on the command line is opened in a new view.<br>
 * The core behavior of this feature is implemented in {@link org.jhotdraw.app.Application#configure}.<br>
 * Data is supplied by the feature <em>Launch application</em>.<br>
 * This feature triggers the following feature: <em>Open URIs on launch</em>.<br>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Open URIs on launch</em><br>
 * When the application is started, a view is opened for each URI.
 * If no URI is supplied, an empty view is opened.<br>
 * The core behavior of this feature is implemented in {@link org.jhotdraw.app.Application#start}.<br>
 * The {@code start()} method parses the command line parameters.
 * If the command line specifies URI's, a view is created for each URI and then {@link org.jhotdraw.app.View#read} is
 * invoked.<br>
 * Otherwise a single view is created and then {@link org.jhotdraw.app.View#clear} is invoked.<br>
 * Data is supplied by the features <em>Open last URI on launch</em>, <em>Open URIs from command line on
 * launch</em>.<br>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Allow multiple views per URI</em><br>
 * Allows opening the same URI in multiple views.
 * When the feature is disabled, opening multiple views is prevented, and saving
 * to a file for which another view is open is prevented.<br>
 * The core behavior of this feature is implemented by actions that open and save files.<br>
 * Known actions are org.jhotdraw.app.action.file.OpenFileAction,
 * {@link org.jhotdraw.app.action.file.OpenRecentFileAction},
 * {@link org.jhotdraw.app.action.file.SaveFileAction},
 * {@link org.jhotdraw.app.action.file.LoadFileAction},
 * {@link org.jhotdraw.app.action.file.LoadRecentFileAction},
 * {@link org.jhotdraw.app.action.file.ExportFileAction},
 * {@link org.jhotdraw.app.action.app.OpenApplicationFileAction}.<br>
 * This feature is enabled if {@link org.jhotdraw.app.ApplicationModel#isAllowMultipleViewsPerURI()} returns true.<br>
 * The list of open URI's can be retrieved via {@link org.jhotdraw.app.Application#getViews}
 * and then calling {@link org.jhotdraw.app.View#getURI}.
 * </p>
